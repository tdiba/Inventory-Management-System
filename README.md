### Project Overview

This report presents the findings of an extensive inventory analysis conducted on a company's current inventory levels, supplier details, and restock history. The goal was to optimize inventory levels, identify products that are under or overstated in stock, and predict future inventory needs. The analysis utilized a dataset encompassing 50 inventory items, 10 suppliers, and 100 restock records.


### Analysis Overview

  #### Optimization of Inventory Levels
  
      - Inventory items were categorized into 'Low Stock', 'Medium Stock', and 'High Stock' based on their current quantities.
      - Key findings indicate a balanced distribution across these categories, although a few items were identified as having critically low or high stock levels.

  #### Identification of Under/Overstated Products
  
      - The comparison between current stock levels and average restock quantities helped identify items that were significantly over or understated.
      - A few items were flagged for immediate attention due to their deviation from typical stock levels.

  #### Prediction of Future Inventory Needs
  
      - Future restocking requirements were estimated based on past restock patterns, including average restock quantities and frequencies.
      - The analysis provided predictions on when specific items are likely to require restocking, aiding in proactive inventory management.


### Visualizations and Insights

Several visualizations were created to aid in understanding the data:

  - A Pie Chart showing the proportion of stock levels across categories.
  - A Bar Chart of the top 10 items, highlighting their inventory levels and categories.
  - A Histogram displaying the distribution of restock quantities.
  - A Heat Map indicating the inventory turnover rates for different categories.
  - A Scatter Plot to visualize the stock status of items in relation to their average restock quantities.

These visualizations have provided clear insights into the inventory status and have highlighted areas requiring immediate attention.


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:

- Reassess Stock Levels: For items identified as under or overstated, a deeper analysis into their demand and supply patterns is recommended.
- Revise Restocking Strategies: Consider adjusting restocking frequencies or quantities for items with abnormal turnover rates.
- Implement Predictive Tools: Leverage the predictive analysis in the decision-making process for future inventory management.


### Conclusion

The inventory analysis has been instrumental in highlighting the strengths and potential areas of improvement in the company's inventory management. By addressing the identified issues and incorporating the recommendations, the company can achieve more efficient and effective inventory management, leading to cost savings and improved service levels.
